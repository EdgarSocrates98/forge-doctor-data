"""ARCH### - architecture contract drift checks.

Each check compares the declared contract (``platform-contract.yml``)
against implemented/declared planes via :func:`detect_drift`. Runtime-plane
drift (ARCH005, runtime ARCH001) is additionally surfaced through
``forge-doctor-data architecture drift --runtime <artifact>``.
