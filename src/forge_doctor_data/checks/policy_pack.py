"""Organization policy packs - declarative forbid/require rules.

Rule ids are org-defined (e.g. ``ORG001``), so findings produced here
carry the pack's own check ids and can be governed by severity policy
and suppressions like any built-in rule. When no packs are configured
the check emits nothing - policy packs are strictly opt-in.
