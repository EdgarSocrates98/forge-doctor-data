"""GRAPH### checks over GraphProjectModel - modeling + traversal families.

Heuristics stay honest: MEDIUM/LOW confidence, never ERROR. The model
reports structure and traversal shape - never estimated cost (no
cardinalities without runtime data) and never "use a graph database".

Numbering follows spec 174/175: 001-010 modeling, 020-025 traversal.
GRAPH026 and GRAPH030 are local extensions beyond the spec'd set.
