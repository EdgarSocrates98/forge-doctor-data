"""Optimization intelligence 2.0 (spec 239, program P phase 5).

Multi-objective optimization opportunities grounded in the behavioral
evidence planes from specs 235-238: performance signals/findings, cost
drivers/findings, reliability models/objectives, physical designs, and
the platform graph. Extends ``core/optimization/static.py`` — the v1 finding→
candidate pipeline is untouched; v2 is the opportunity layer.

Every opportunity shows benefit AND tradeoff, names its protected
constraints (SLA/criticality/capability), and carries an experiment
plan — the engine proposes, labs measure; nothing deploys.
