# Acceptance Criteria
- `forge-doctor-data workspace` keeps discovery (group, invoke_without_command)
- `workspace scan` runs scan per nested project, aggregates w/ project column; --format json|sarif|text; --profile applies per project
- `workspace diff base...head` per-subproject finding diff (project-prefixed)
